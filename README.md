# axor-lab

Axor Lab — standalone research surface for the Axor governance stack: bring an agent, run attack scenarios ungoverned/governed on simulated tools, investigate single trials (EvidenceCase), replay governance verdicts exactly, and publish reproducible bundles.

- **[docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)** — the production-ready implementation plan (phases, reuse map, milestones, definition of done).
- **[contracts/](contracts/)** — the engineering contract: 9 JSON Schemas, statistics/claims/provenance semantics, lifecycle, threat model, MVP contract, vertical slice, acceptance tests. Where prose and a contract disagree, the contract wins. Validate: `cd contracts && python3 validate.py && python3 validate_slice.py`.
- **[docs/design/](docs/design/)** — product narrative (spec-lab v0.3), packaging/economics, bench format guide, UI mocks.
